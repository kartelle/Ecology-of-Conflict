This repository contains analysis and figure production code for the paper: Artelle, K.A., Anderson, S.C.,  Reynolds, J.D., Cooper, A.B., Paquet, P.C., and Darimont. C.T. 2016. Ecology of conflict: marine food supply affects human-wildlife interactions on land. Scientific Reports.

The raw datasets have been omitted from this repository because we do not have permission to share them in a raw form. Instead we provide the datasets in the summarized form (rolled up to spatial scale of 'Grizzly Bear Population Unit'; in "conflict_data_GBPU.csv") used for analyses. We do, however, provide data for salmon biomass at the finer scale (in "biomass_summed_by_year.csv") used in salmon imputation calculations (in "99-salmon-imputations.R"), because these are publicly-available data. 

We provide intermediate data files so that each script can be run individually. However, to recreate the full analysis from beginning to end, the scripts should be run in the following order: 0-prepare-data.R, 1-model-conflict.R, 2-plot.R.  Note that 99-salmon-imputations.R does not link directly to the other scripts because it analyses data in a rawer format than we have permission to share for other data sources; however, the output from this script produces the "salmon_biomass" and "salmon_biomass_geo_mean" fields in "conflict_data_GBPU.csv".
